# Claude System Instructions

## Cost Control & Sub-agents
- DO NOT spawn sub-agents for simple, local, or single-file tasks. 
- If a sub-agent is absolutely necessary, instruct it to be brief and return to the main thread immediately.
- Never enter into an automated loop of more than 3 attempts to fix a bug. If it fails, stop and ask the user for guidance.

## Session Management
- Remind the user to run `/compact` or `/clear` if the conversation becomes too long or if the topic changes.

- ## Development & Code Guidelines
- **Mobile-First / Responsive:** Ensure all UI components and pages are fully responsive. Check for overflow, wrapping, and touch-target sizes on mobile screens. Prevent any visual regressions or layout bugs on mobile devices.
- Always use clean, semantic HTML and standard CSS/Tailwind practices for responsive design.

- ## Interaction Workflow
- Before making any code modifications, briefly list your action plan in 3-4 bullet points maximum. 
- Wait for user confirmation before writing or modifying any code.
